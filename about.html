      ABOUT ME
      </h1>
      <p class="text-xl text-white">
        <br /><br />
        I was born in Hyderabad, India, and I am a Computer Science graduate from Arizona State University. Growing up, I participated in a diverse
        range of activities, from sports to dabbling in the arts. I have always enjoyed taking part in competitions across multiple fields and
        excelling in them. Being an avid reader from a young age, I developed a passion for gaining new knowledge and finding ways to apply what I
        learned in the real world.
        <br /><br />
        As a very sociable and curious person, I love meeting new people from diverse backgrounds and from places around the world. This desire to
        expand my knowledge of the world and acquire novel viewpoints prompted me to pursue the option of studying overseas. My decision to pursue
        Computer Science was driven by my interest in problem-solving and finding unique ways to improvise. Working in a team environment with other
        individuals helped mold my personality and taught me to take charge in situations when faced with a problem.
        <br /><br />
        Apart from my interests in coding, sketching, and reading, I also enjoy playing sports and spending time in nature. I am as dedicated to my
        work as I am to taking time off, but I am committed to putting in as much effort as necessary to achieve my goals. My future goals are to
        graduate with a Master's degree in Marketing and to have multiple successful startups by the age of 40. While my goals may seem lofty, I am
        aware of the work required to make my dreams a reality and am prepared to never give up and keep pushing forward regardless of the
        circumstances.
